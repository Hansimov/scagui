classdef TraceSet < handle
% TraceSet is similar to TraceFile,
%   the difference is that TraceSet does not have a file entity when created.
% TraceSet is the intermediate result of some processing steps,
%   while TraceFile always has an `.mat` or .`trs` equivalent.
% It is hard to choose which form is good to abstract the variables during our processing.
